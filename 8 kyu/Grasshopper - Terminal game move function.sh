# Terminal game move function
# In this game, the hero moves from left to right. The player rolls the dice and moves the number of spaces indicated by the dice two times.
# 
# Create a function for the terminal game that takes the current position of the hero and the roll (1-6) and return the new position.
# 
# Example:
# move(3, 6) should equal 15
# -----------------------------------------------------------

position=$1
roll=$2
echo $((position + roll * 2))
